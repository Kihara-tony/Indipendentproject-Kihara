    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>I am from High school where I graduated on the year 2018. Since I was idling at home and I had a very great passion on computers and specificly on the programming part, I decided it was better to excersise my passion by joining <em>Moringa School</em>.Coding has been challenging and fun at the same time. Challenging in that to learn something new is always hard especially trying to master content of which am sure we will incline to the system with no much of time.Fun because it makes you be a <em>magician</em> and do things that most people fear to do and can't do. Especially when executing a code and you notice changes it make one feel so powerful.</p>
    <p>I like watching movies, reading novels, executing strange lines of codes and listening to soothing music. My hobbies is learning new skills, travelling, looking at the sky and stars at night and dancing.The main skills I believe I have is coding skills, arithmetic skills, listening skills,education skills and cycling skills. </p>
